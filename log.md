# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 26, 2021


**Today's Progress**: Started with the basics of html

**Thoughts:** It was good, since I kind of know a little about HTML it was mostly like reviewing. Thought I got to learn the importance of reading documentation.



### Day 2: October 27, 2021


**Today's Progress**: Learnt about tables and forms in html and some css

**Thoughts:** tables are a little confusing becauses of the nested tags it must contain.
