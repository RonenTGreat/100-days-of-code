# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 8th June 2022

**Today's Progress:** Started with the day 1 of Angela Yu's 100 days of python course, used the basic of variables, input and print functions to create a simple program that generates a band name.  

**Thoughts:** I actually know a little of Python so it was that difficult but I learnt some new tricks and I am glad I didn't skip it. I don't really like nesting fuctions within functions but I saw a beautiful implementation of it. 

### Day 2: 9th June 2022

**Today's Progress:** Visited data types, type conversion and formatting strings using F-string. Then I used the concept to create a tip calculator program.

**Thoughts:** Currently it feels like I am revising the basic in Python.

### Day 3: 10th June 2022

**Today's Progress:** Learnt about the if, elif and else statement then the logical operators "or" also "and". Then I used the concept to create a short adventure game. 

**Thoughts:** The exercises today were a little challenging, took a while to solve some of them but I did it! 

### Day 4: 11th June 2022

**Today's Progress:** Studied on randomisation using https://askpython.com and also studied about Lists. Used those concepts to program a simple rock, paper, scissors. Also solved some exercises on 2d list.  

**Thoughts:** 

### Day 5: 12th June 2022

**Today's Progress:** Learnt about Loops and Range, then I used the concept to create a simple password generator that asks the user for the number of letters, symbols and digits the user wants in the password. 

**Thoughts:** It so funny I had to apply try and error for this project but later found out there was a simpler way around it.


### Day 6: 13th June 2022

**Today's Progress:**  Studied on while loops and functions today, though I didn't create any project today I did solve some problems from https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html using the concepts. It was very challenging ,especiallyHurdle 3 and 4. 

**Thoughts:** I was able to finish early today so I decide to get an introduction to tailwindcss


### Day 7: 14th June 2022

**Today's Progress:** Didn't learn any new concepts today, used today to create a hangman game using Python. 

**Thoughts:** The beginning of any adventure may seem overwhelming but breaking it down really does the trick. Programming is a great big adventure. 


### Day 8: 15th June 2022

**Today's Progress:** Still on functions, learn about parameters and arguments(positional arguments and keyword arguments). For today's project I created a Caesar Cipher. 

**Thoughts:** 



### Day 9: 16th June 2022

**Today's Progress:** Learnt about dictionary and nesting dictionary into list and vice versa, then I created a blind bid auction that stores the name and bidding price into a dictionary and there prints out the winner of the auction. 

**Thoughts:** Today lesson was quick but I procrastinated a litte
