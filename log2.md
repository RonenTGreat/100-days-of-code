# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 8th June 2022

**Today's Progress:** Started with the day 1 of Angela Yu's 100 days of python course, used the basic of variables, input and print functions to create a simple program that generates a band name.  

**Thoughts:** I actually know a little of Python so it was that difficult but I learnt some new tricks and I am glad I didn't skip it. I don't really like nesting fuctions within functions but I saw a beautiful implementation of it. 

### Day 2: 9th June 2022

**Today's Progress:** Visited data types, type conversion and formatting strings using F-string. Then I used the concept to create a tip calculator program.

**Thoughts:** Currently it feels like I am revising the basic in Python.

### Day 3: 10th June 2022

**Today's Progress:** Learnt about the if, elif and else statement then the logical operators "or" also "and". Then I used the concept to create a short adventure game. 

**Thoughts:** The exercises today were a little challenging, took a while to solve some of them but I did it!
